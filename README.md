### Hi there 👋

 🌱 I’m currently learning VueJs, Laravel, NodeJS, .Net Framework (C#), AdnisJS Framework, ElectronJs and Apache Cordova.
 
 🔒 My first language and frameworks which I have learned was PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery, and JavaScript.
 
 🌍 I like to share my knowledge with anyone who likes to get it.
 
 💻 Now I working on my first web app (full featured file manager) - Maybe it will be open source 😉
